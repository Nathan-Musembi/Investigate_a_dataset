<ol>
<li> PatientId
<li>  AppointmentID
<li> Gender

<li> ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
<li> ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
<li> ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
<li> The last column says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
</ol> In this project the major question to be answered is; 
What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
